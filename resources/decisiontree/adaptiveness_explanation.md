**Adaptability in a nutshell**
Adaptiveness means that the system can learn and change its behavior after it is first used. The AI Act does not require an AI system is able to adapt for it to be an AI system. The ability to adapt is therefore optional.

**But if adaptability is optional for AI systems, why then care?**
Adaptable systems do not stay the same. They learn and evolve. Every time an AI system learns something new, there is a chance that it will pose a greater risk than before. Therefore, you should care if your system is able to adapt, as it will indicate the need for you to oversee it.

**How to know if your system exhibits adaptivess after deployment**
If you are unsure whether your system can exhibit adaptiveness after deployment, you should ask yourself if the system can change itself without a human reprogramming it. If the answer is yes, the system is adaptive and you should be aware of the risks it can pose over time. If not, that is fine too, the system can still be an AI system.
