**Objectives in a nutshell**
AI systems are designed to operate according to one or more objectives. AI objectives are the goals the system tries to achieve. 

These goals can be clearly written into the code (explicit objectives) or they can be learned from data (implicit objectives). 

**How to know if your system is designed to operate according to one or more objectives**
If you are unsure whether your system has either explicit or implicit goals, you must ask if the system process inputs in a way that aims to achieve a specific result, even if that goal is not directly coded. The answer will in many cases be yes.
