If you are unsure whether your system is able to able to influence physical or virtual environments, you have two choices:

1. **Assume it is able to influence physical or virtual environments (recommended).**

2. **Assume it is not able to influence physical or virtual environments.**

We recommend you assume it _is_.

**Why?**  
Reference to ‘physical or virtual environments’ indicates that the influence of an AI system may be both to tangible, physical objects (e.g. robot arm) and to virtual environments, including digital spaces, data flows, and software ecosystems. AI systems must be able to influence their environments, which means that they must have impact. An AI system that does not operate a physical object or does not influence the software it is implemented into does not influence anything.

**Consideration - for and against**
If you assume that your system is able to influence physical or virtual environments, it might be covered by the AI Act, but if your system is not prohibited or high-risk, the rules you need to follow are usually simple. Therefore, this approach makes sure you are on the safe side, as you do not miss anything.

If you wrongly assume that your system is not able to influence physical or virtual environments, you could unknowingly break the law, which could lead to fines or other penalties.

**When in doubt, assume your system is able to influence physical or virtual environments.**  
Better safe than sorry.
