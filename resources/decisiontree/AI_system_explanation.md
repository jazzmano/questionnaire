An AI system is defined like this in Article 3(1) of the AI Act:

‘AI system’ means a machine-based system that is designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment, and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments;

To decide if what you are dealing with is an AI system, your system must therefore check of seven boxes: 

1) your system *must* be **machine-based**, 
2) your system *must* be designed to operate with varying levels of **autonomy**,
3) your system *may* be able to exhibit **adaptiveness**,
4) your system *must* act for explicit or implicit **objectives**,
5) your system *must* be able to **infer**, 
6) your system *must* be able to generate **outputs**, and 
7) your system *must* be able to influence **physical or virtual environments**.

If your system checks of 1)-2) and 4)-7), your system is an AI system. If not, your system is not an AI system.
