A customer support chatbot for an e-commerce company that uses machine learning to improve itself over time. After being the e-commerce company begins to use the chatbot (deployment), the chatbot monitors its interactions with users. If users frequently rephrase a question the chatbot fails to answer, it uses those examples to retrain its internal model (adaptiveness). Over time, it starts recognizing those variations and responds better, even though it was not initially programmed to handle them. The chatbot exhibits adaptiveness after deployment.
