Adaptiveness means that a system can change. Imagine you have a chatbot that learns from the conversations it has, meaning it is able to adjust its answers to fit the user. This would mean that the chatbot can "exhibit adaptiveness" after its deployment, and you would therefore have to answer "yes". It is not required that AI systems are able to adapt, but it will often be the case.
