3. Adaptiveness

(22) The third element of the definition in Article 3(1) AI Act is that the system ‘may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment’. The concepts of autonomy and adaptiveness are two 
distinct but closely related concepts. They are often discussed together but they represent 
different dimensions of an AI system’s functionality. Recital 12 AI Act clarifies that 
‘adaptiveness’ refers to self-learning capabilities, allowing the behaviour of the system 
to change while in use. The new behaviour of the adapted system may produce different 
results from the previous system for the same inputs. 

(23) The use of the term ‘may’ in relation to this element of the definition indicates that a 
system may, but does not necessarily have to, possess adaptiveness or self-learning 
capabilities after deployment to constitute an AI system. Accordingly, a system’s ability 
to automatically learn, discover new patterns, or identify relationships in the data beyond 
what it was initially trained on is a facultative and thus not a decisive condition for 
determining whether the system qualifies as an AI system.
