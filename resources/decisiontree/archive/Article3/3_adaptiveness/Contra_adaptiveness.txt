As adaptiveness is not determining for whether an AI system is indeed an AI system, there is no direct consequence related to labelling your system as not being able to exhibit adaptiveness after deployment. However, by not doing so, the most apparent risk is that you fail to continuously re-assess the risk the system poses under the AI Act, as non-adaptive systems do not evolve and therefore continues to pose the same risk as initially.
