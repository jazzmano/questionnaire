A legal information chatbot that answers questions based on a fixed decision tree coded by developers. The chatbot answers based on pre-defined logic. If you ask it a question outside of what it was programmed to understand, it gives a default response like, “I’m sorry, I can’t help with that.” Its behavior never changes unless a developer manually updates the system. The chatbot does not exhibit adaptiveness after deployment.
