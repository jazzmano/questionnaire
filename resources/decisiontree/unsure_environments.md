If you are unsure whether your system is able to able to influence physical or virtual environments, you have two choices:

1. **Assume it _is_ able to influence physical or virtual environments (recommended).**

2. **Assume it _is not_ able to influence physical or virtual environments.**

We recommend you assume it _is_ (option 1).

**Why?**  
_Why choose option 1?_
If you assume your system is able to to influence physical or virtual environments, it might be covered by the AI Act (if the other conditions for having an AI system are also fulfilled), but if it is not prohibited or high-risk, the rules you need to follow are usually simple. Therefore, this approach makes sure you are on the safe side.

Reference to ‘physical or virtual environments’ indicates that the influence of an AI system may be both to tangible, physical objects (e.g. robot arm) and to virtual environments, including digital spaces, data flows, and software ecosystems. AI systems must be able to influence their environments, which means that they must have impact. An AI system that does not operate a physical object or does not influence the software it is implemented into does not influence anything.

Assuming your system is able to influence its environment is the safer position. It encourages you to consider the potential impacts of your system’s behaviour, and to put appropriate oversight and safeguards in place. This helps reduce legal and reputational risk and builds trust with users and stakeholders.

_Why choose option 2?_
You should choose Option 2 only if your system does not influence its environment in any way. In practice, almost all functional systems do influences their environment(s), either by controlling physical objects or by affecting virtual environments, such as data flows.

However, if your system is purely theoretical, e.g., a system used solely for internal testing without influencing any real-world process or digital environment, then it may not exert any influence. In such cases, option 2 may be appropriate.

Many systems that appear passive or internal do in fact influence their environments in subtle ways. If you are unsure, it is safer to assume your system does influence its environment and apply appropriate governance.

**When in doubt, assume your system is able to influence physical or virtual environments.** Better safe than sorry.
