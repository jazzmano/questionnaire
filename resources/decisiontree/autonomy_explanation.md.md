**Autonomy in a nutshell**
Autonomy means the system's ability to make decisions without direct human control or intervention. All AI systems must be at least _somewhat_ autonomous. If the system is only able to produce something if a human is involved, it is not autonomous. The more an AI system can do independently, the more autonomous it is. 

**How to know if your system is autonomous**
If you're unsure whether your IT system has autonomy, ask yourself this: Is a human necessary in every single step the system takes, or can the system do _at least one step_ on its own without being told exactly what to do? If a human is needed all the way through, the system is not autonomous. Otherwise, it has a level of autonomy.
