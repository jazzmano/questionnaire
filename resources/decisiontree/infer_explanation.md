**Inference in a nutshell**
Inference is an AI system's ability  to _figure out_ how to produce an output from an input. Inference is often referred to as the AI system's ability to think and is what really separates AI from basic software. Inference is not about what the user gives as input, but how the system figures out what to output based on that input. 

**How to know if your system has the ability to infer**
If you are unsure of whether your system has the ability to infer, you should ask yourself whether your system has the ability to figure out *how* to process the input to generate an output. Be careful not to mix inference up with autonomy - inference is the ability to create, autonomy is the ability to decide.
