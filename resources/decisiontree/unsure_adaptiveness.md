If you’re unsure whether your system can **adapt** or **change its behavior over time**, you have two choices:

1. **Assume it can adapt after deployment.**

2. **Assume it cannot adapt after deployment.**
  
We recommend you assume it _can_.

**Why?**  
Even though the AI Act does _not_ require a system to adapt after deployment in order to be classified as an AI system, adaptiveness still matters a lot. If your system can change itself, then the version you have today may be very different from the version you had last week. 

Imagine that you deploy a low-risk marketing AI that seems harmless. But over time, the system updates itself and starts using aggressive and prohibited tactics to boost results, so that it becomes a prohibited AI system, without you noticing. Now you are in trouble.

Therefore, adaptive systems must be monitored regularly. They evolve. If you are not watching, they may turn into something you did not approve or may not want - possibly something illegal.

So unless you are _absolutely sure_ that your system doesn’t change after deployment, assume that it does.

**When in doubt, assume your system can adapt.**  
Better safe than sorry.
