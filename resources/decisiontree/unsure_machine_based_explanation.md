If you are unsure whether your system is machine-based, you have two choices:

1. **Option 1: Assume it *is* machine-based.**

2. **Option 2: Assume it is *not* machine-based**

We recommend you assume it *is* - option 1.

**Why?**  
*Why choose option 1?*
If you assume your system is machine-based, it might be covered by the AI Act (if the other conditions for having an AI system are also fulfilled), but if it is not prohibited or high-risk, the rules you need to follow are usually simple. Therefore, this approach makes sure you are on the safe side. Additionally, machines are often regulated by other EU legislation. 

If you assume your system is machine-based, it gives you a clue that other EU rules — like the EU machinery regulation — might apply. These are rules you might overlook if you did not think of your system as being based on a machine. This assumption therefore helps you spot legal requirements you could otherwise miss.

*Why choose option 2?*
If you assume it is *not* machine-based, you are taking a risk, if you are not sure. Most systems are machine-based. If your assessment is wrong, and your system is actually covered by the AI Act, you might break the rules without knowing it, and that can lead to sanctions (for example fines).  

**So: when in doubt, assume your system is machine-based.** Better safe than sorry.
