If you are unsure whether your system is machine-based, you have two choices:

1. **Option 1: Assume it *is* machine-based.**

2. **Option 2: Assume it is *not* machine-based**

We recommend you assume it *is* (option 1).

**Why?**  
*Why choose option 1?*
If you assume that your system is machine-based, you stay on the safe side. It might be covered by the AI Act (if the other legal criteria for an AI system are met), but if it is not prohibited or high-risk, the rules you must follow are usually simple. This assumption helps ensure you do not overlook legal obligations.

Additionally, if you treat your system as machine-based, it reminds you that other EU laws may also apply, e.g., the EU Machinery Regulation. These rules are sometimes missed if you do not think of your system as a machine. Choosing option 1 helps you identify and comply with these other legal requirements.

By taking this approach, you also strengthen your ability to market the system as fully compliant across all relevant EU product regulations, which can support customer trust and accelerate sales, especially in regulated industries.

*Why choose option 2?*
If you assume that your system is not machine-based, you are taking a risk, unless you are absolutely certain. Many systems today do qualify as machine-based. If your assessment is wrong and your system is in fact covered by the AI Act, you could unknowingly infringe on the AI Act, which may result in sanctions (such as fines).


**When in doubt, assume your system is machine-based.** Better safe than sorry.
